# Personal Health Data Analysis in Jupyter Notebook

A weekend exercise on analyzing my fitness tracker data, as Apple's Health app is very limited.
I'm to expand on the file and clean up the code over time. End goal is to have a reusable notebook with good graphical representation of trends over time. The data is collected from iPhone and Garmin Vivosmart HR and exported to CSV via the QS Access App from the App Store.
